# Code Sample

## Files

### Tohughts.js

This is a code sample from my private repo `balance`.

This code sample is a set of AWS Lambda functions. Each one is making a call to one of the `userTable` frunctions, which is hooked up to a DynamoDB instance.

### App.js

This is a code sample from my public site `themindfulpug.com`

This sample is the base component that setup up and renders `themindfulpug.com`. This page uses React hooks, a small amount of emotion, and the basic `js-cookie` module.

### Dashboard-fragment.ts

This is a code sample from my private repo for `balance.themindfulpug.com`

This sample is a display of my use of Typescript, the React context api, and `async/await`. When the page load or the user changes, it will make a call to get a user's thoughts and update accordingly.

## Notes

All of these repos use `standard` for linting, `Prettier` for formating, `Webpack` for building, `Babel` for traspiling, and `Jest` for testing.
